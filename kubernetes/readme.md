# Kubernetes

## Overview

All Kubernetes resource manifests and related learning materials are stored in this module. To work with a specific
resource, navigate to its corresponding subdirectory, where you can apply the resource using the YAML manifests, create
a new manifest and commit it for later use, or read and update the available information about the resources.

Note: Do not include or expose any sensitive information in the manifests.
