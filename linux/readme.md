# Linux

## Idea behind the directory

The main idea is to become more familiar with Linux and core topics that every developer should know. Some notes may go
more in-depth into a specific topic, while others may cover just the basics.

Any configurations related to Linux-specific tools, such as the terminal, shell, Vim/Neovim configurations, or others,
should also be placed somewhere under this directory.

When learning a scripting language like Bash, any produced source code can also be included in this directory, as long
as it is for learning purposes.
